    <h1>Database Management System</h1>
    <br>
                <p> A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is
                    designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. 
                    It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well
                    as manage the security and access controls for that database.
                    DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve the data in 
                    convenient and efficient manner. A database is a collection of 
                    interrelated data which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, 
                    and deletion of data from the database and organizes the data in the 
                    form of tables, views, schemas, reports, etc. For Example, a university
                    database organizes the data about students, faculty, admin staff, etc.
                    which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data 
                    from it.

                        <li>Data</li> : Data is the raw material that can be processed for 
                        any computing machine. For example âˆ’ Employee name, Product name,
                        Name of the student, Marks of the student, Mobile number, Image etc. 
                        <br>
                        <li>Info</li> : Information is the data that has been converted 
                        into more useful or intelligent form. For example: Report card sheet.
            
            The information is needed for the following reasons:<br>
            1. To gain knowledge about the surroundings.<br>
            2. To keep the system up to date. <br>
            3. To know about the rules and regulations of the society.<br>

            <li>Metadata</li> : Metadata can be a directory in the database that 
            allows users to easily sort and filter data by type 
            and establish relationships between different data sets.
            <br>
            <li>Data Dictionary</li> : Data Dictionary in DBMS provides 
            additional information about relationships between multiple 
            database tables, helps to organize data, and prevents data 
            redundancy in DBMS. A data dictionary is a set of files that 
            contain a database's metadata. Thus, it is also known as a 
            metadata repository.
            <br>

            <li>Database</li> : A database is an electronically stored, 
            systematic collection of data. It can contain any type of data, 
            including words, numbers, images, videos, and files. We can use 
            software called a database management system (DBMS) to store, retrieve, 
            and edit data.
            <br>

            <li>Table</li> : A table in the DBMS is the logical 
            representation of data having a group of linked information 
            that can be detained in the table format; the table can able 
            to store data in identified number of columns and rows like a 
            spreadsheet, and every row can constitute a remarkable record, 
            and each column can constitute a field
            <br>

            <li>Tuple(s)</li> : In the context of DBMS, a tuple refers to a single 
            row or record in a database table. It is an ordered set of values 
            representing a specific entity or object. Each attribute or column 
            in a table corresponds to a value in the tuple.
            <br>

            <li>Field(s)</li> : A database field is a set of data values, of the 
            same data type, in a table. It is also referred to as a column or an 
            attribute. Most databases also allow fields to hold complex data like 
            pictures, entire files, and even movie clips. A field that allows the 
            same data type does not mean it only has simple text values.
