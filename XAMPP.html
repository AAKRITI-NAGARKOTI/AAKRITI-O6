    <p>STEP 4- Click to Allow access or deactivate the firewall and any other antivirus software because it can hamper the process of installation.

    <p>STEP 5- Just before the installation, a pop-up window appears with a warning to disable UAC. User Account Control (UAC) interrupts the XAMPP installation because it restricts the access to write to the C: drive. Therefore, it is suggested to disable it for the period of installation.
